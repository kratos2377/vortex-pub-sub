- [ ] User Online Status does not change when socket disconnects
- [x] If user changes its status to "Ready" Before next user joins. the status is not refelcted in next users lobby screen ( ISSUE is with API the status does not change in DB either)


- [ ] Look if we can paginate get ongoing_games_for_users and make sure all games are unique -> (Its possible A is friends with B,C and both B,C are part of same match or lobby playing the same game)
